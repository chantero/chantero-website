        <p>
            You may love Taylor Swift, or you may hate her, or you may be indifferent. But whatever you say or think about her, it is undeniable that Taylor Swift is a force of nature.
        </p>

        <p>
            While I may not consider myself a “Swiftie” per se, I do enjoy Taylor Swift’s music. Her poppy songs are ear candy, and her melancholic songs… well let’s just say I have played some on loop far too many times than I would care to admit to help ease my sorrowful heart.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here are a few food for thought (and action!) which I hope to adopt in my life - inspired by Taylor Swift, in the ”TAYLOR” acronym!
        </p>

        <br>

        <h3><span style="color:#B14A78;">TURN AROUND</span> the negativity, and use it as a <span style="color:#B14A78;">TAILWIND</span></h3><br>

                <ul>
                    <li>Taylor has been subject to a lot of criticism and negative comments, one of the most “infamous” is being allegedly impliedly called a “snake”.</li><br>

                    <li>What did she do? She turned it around, and this sparked a whole new sound and aesthetic - the “Reputation” era</li><br>


                </ul>

            <em>Do not be discouraged if people look down on you, or criticise you, or think negatively about you. Instead, turn it around, and use it as a potent tailwind to drive yourself to achieve what you want to do. </em><br><br>




        <h3><span style="color:#7E6AAE;">ADDRESS</span> your mistakes, try to do better next time. Rinse and repeat</h3><br>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>In life, you will inevitably misspeak, under-react, self-sabotage, overthink, not think at all, ruin good moments for yourself and others, deny wrongdoing, not take steps to make it right, feel guilty, let guilt eat at you, hit rock bottom</li><br>

                    <li>Address the pain you caused, try to do better next time, rinse and repeat</li><br>
                
                    <li>These mistakes will cause you to lose things, but losing things doesn't just mean losing. A lot of the time, when we lose things, we gain things too</li><br>

                </ul>

            <em>You will make mistakes. Be resilient, and not let it get you down permanently. Every time you make a mistake, get back up, and take action to ADDRESS your mistakes; <br>and try to do better (and try not repeat the same mistakes) the next time. Even if you lost something due to your mistake, it is not the end, you might find that you gain other things also.</em><br><br>
        <br>
        


        <h3><span style="color:#4C82B8;">YOU</span> have to live <span style="color:#4C82B8;">YOUR LIFE</span>, in spite of fear, and in spite of people who do not understand you</h3><br>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Today, Taylor is at the top of the music world, and it is easy to see why. But it was not always so.</li><br>

                    <li>When Taylor was making the transition from country music to pop, apparently there was a lot of pushback.</li><br>

                    <li>But Taylor knew what she wanted, and she fought for it</li><br>
                </ul>

            <em>YOUR LIFE is YOURS to live. You don’t have to be what others want you to be. Have courage to live and fight for what YOU WANT over and over again, despite having fears and doubts, and despite what other people may think.</em><br><br>
        <br>
        


        <h3><span style="color:#C44A3D;">LOVE</span> what you do, and <span style="color:#C44A3D;">LOVE</span> the people who love you and make your dreams happen</h3><br>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Taylor clearly loves making music and sharing her music with the world (despite the troubles that she gets due to her glitzy career, i.e.the ridiculous amounts of media attention, and the negative effects that arise from it)</li><br>

                    <li>Taylor is also known for genuinely appreciating her “Swifties”, hosting secret session at her home, sending them gifts and little messages</li><br>

                    <li>And we have also heard the news about the eye-watering bonuses her team got working on the Eras Tour. So, appreciation in the form of money for those who work hard to make her dreams come true.</li><br>
                </ul>

            <em>You would only be willing to put in the effort, go the extra mile, and bear all the suffering that it may entail, when you are doing something that you LOVE (or when you do things for the people that you LOVE). So do what you LOVE, and LOVE what you do. If you haven’t found it yet, keep searching. Besides loving what you do, it is always important to remember to love and appreciate those who are there for you, and those who have your back</em><br><br>
        <br>
 

         <h3><span style="color:#B14A78;">OWN</span> your life's work</h3><br>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Fighting for ownership of her Masters (as in the recordings of her old catalog of music) is one of the big battles of Taylor Swift’s life.</li><br>

                    <li>It is hard to believe that even one of the biggest artistes in the world would have to face such a challenge at the peak of her career - fighting to own her own life’s work.</li><br>

                    <li>But of course, the consequence of a binding contract cannot be overlooked. Ultimately, I believe this battle played out pretty much in her favour, if we look at it on a balance</li><br>

                    <li>This shows the importance of owning your work or things that are precious to you - do not simply give it away or let go of it or let others take from you/li><br>
                </ul>

            <em>Often times, when we are a weaker bargaining position, it is not always easy to get a good (or even fair) deal, or to keep ownership of all rights to your work. But be wise and do not sell yourself short. (And consult a lawyer who is acting for you!)</em><br><br>
        <br>
               

         <h3><span style="color:#7E6AAE;">RELEASE</span> and let go of things that weigh you down</h3><br>
            
                <ul>
                    <li>Life can be heavy, especially if you try to carry it all at once. Part of growing up and moving into new chapters of your life is about catch and release. </li><br>

                    <li>Know what things to keep and what things to release - Decide what is yours to hold and let the rest go </li><br>
                    
                    <li>One toxic relationship can outweigh so many, wonderful simple joys. </li><br>
                    
                    <li>You get to pick what your life has time and room for. Be discerning.</li><br>
                </ul>

            <em>You can pick what to keep, and what to let go of. Release the bad and toxic things, and catch and keep the good things.</em><br><br>

                <li>Obviously, I do not know Taylor, so everything here is based on her public persona, as interpreted through the lens of my eyes</li>

        <u>Note 2: The Reason For This Post</u>

        <p>
            Lately, I have not been doing well career-wise. I am overwhelmed, burnt out, drained, and down in the dumps. It is not that I have not been working (I have! A lot!), it’s just that there is so much more that I have not managed to do. 
        </p>

        <p>
            So much to do, and it all takes time, and time and energy are limited resources… !  😞😣 I only have one body, and I can only do one thing at a time! And I have no control of others! It is a never-ending source of stress, and it makes me feel sad and incompetent. 
        </p>

        <p>
            “Like why am I struggling when others, who seem to do much more than me, are doing well on top of their work and deadlines?”
        </p>

        <p>
             I feel like I am juggling jars of acid. I keep hoping that I do not drop any on me… but now everything seems to be unraveling! (Anxiety and depression are my roommates, and alcohol is my reluctant friend).
        </p>

        <p>
            So… my career outlook is tragic, but what does this have to do with Taylor Swift? Well, people often say, “find yourself a good role model”.  I figured it’d be fun to consider a celebrity one.
