        <h2>üìñ 3 Books - Mindset, Atomic Habits, The 5 Second Rule</h2>
        <p class="article-date">Created: 22 April 2025, Tuesday | Updated: 12 July 2025, Saturday</p>
          
        <p>These 3 books have inspired me to take small steps to improve myself:</p>
    
        <br><br>
    	<h3>1Ô∏è‚É£ üìï Mindset (by Carol Dweck)</h3><br>

            <em>ü•ú Adopt a "growth mindset" - Our abilities and traits are not fixed. We can change and improve through effort, learning, and persistence.</em><br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>What are the opportunities for learning and growth?</li><br>
                    <li>Form a plan - When, where, and how will I embark on my plan?</li><br>
                    <li>When you encounter a setback, form a new plan - When, where, and how will I act on my new plan?</li><br>
                    <li>How do I maintain and continue to grow?</li><br>
                </ul>

        <br><br>
    	<h3>2Ô∏è‚É£ üìó Atomic Habits (by James Clear)</h3><br>

            <em>ü•ú Focus on building "habits" or "systems". Small changes can compound over time and produce significant and lasting results.</em><br><br>
                <ul>

                <li><u>Set systems, not goals</u>: <br><br>
                    
                    <b>Fix the input, and the output will fix itself.</b> If you set goals or fix the results only, the results may be temporary. But, if you set a good system, you will achieve your goal with lasting results.<br><br>
                    
                    Example: You want a clean room (goal), after you clean your messy room, the room will be clean for a while (achieve goal). If you still keep your messy habits, then the room will get messy again soon (temporary results). BUT, if you change your messy habits (have a system to be cleaner - eg. I will put the stuff back to the drawer immediately after use...), then the goal (clean room) will naturally flow from the good system! (lasting results)</li><br>
                

                <li><u>Persist through the "plateau of latent potential"</u>: <br><br>

                    <b>You may not see results in the beginning, but persist and continue</b>. After you break through the critical threshold, you will see success! <br><br>

                    Example: You knock a stone 100 times and nothing happens, but on the 101st time, the stone breaks. You may not see results for the first 100 knocks, but it is actually doing something... be patient.</li><br>


                <li><u>Focus on who you want to become</u>: <br><br>

                    The most effective way to change your habit is to <b>have an identity change</b> - Decide who you want to be, and prove it to yourself with small wins. Every action you take is a a vote towards being the person you want to be. As the votes build up, so does your new identity.</li><br>



                <li><u>1st Law: Make a Habit "Obvious"</u>: <br><br>

                    (1) <b>Be clear</b> - Example: I will do [behaviour] at [time] in [place].<br><br>

                    (2) <b>Habit Stacking</b> - Pair a new habit on top of something you already do.  Example: After I get out of bed, I will do ten pushups.<br><br>
                    
                    (3) <b>Design your environment for success</b> - Make cues for good habits obvious; make cues for bad habits invisible. 

                    Example: if you want to practice guitar more, put the guitar in the middle of the room. If you play too much video games, unplug the console and put it in the cupboard after use.</li><br>



                <li><u>2nd Law: Make a Habit "Attractive"</u>: <br><br>

                    (1) <b>Temptation Bundling</b> - Pair a habit you "want to build" with something you "like or need to do". Example: Only watch your favourite TV show when you are indoor cycling.<br><br>

                    (2) <b>Join a culture where your desired culture is the normal behavour, and you already have something in common with the group</b> - we tend to imitate habits of (i) people who are close to us, (ii) the many, (iii) the powerful.<br><br>                
                    (3) <b>Break bad habits by making it un-attractive</b> - Highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit  (basically psycho yourself / mindset change) to make the bad habit un-attractive.</li><br>

                   
            

                <li><u>3rd Law: Make it "Easy"</u>: <br><br>

                    <p><em>Use the "2 minutes rule" to build habits. </em>Make your habits easy to start. Start with a "gateway" [easy] habit that you can do within 2 minutes, then slowly build it up.</p><br><br>

                    (1) <b>Take action (practice, not just plan)</b> - The key is to just <b>start doing with repetition (not perfection)</b>. If you focus trying to find the best way to do something, it "feels" like you are doing something, but you didn't actually take any "action" ( = no results). Planning is good, but you also have to do! <br><br>Example: This professor divided the photography class into 2 groups: (a) "Quantity Group" is graded by "quantity" of photos produced, (b) "Quality Group" is graded by the "quality" of photos (only 1 best photo will be graded). In the end, the "Quantity Group" produced the better photos, because in the process of creating 100's of photos, they honed their skills. Don't just plan, practice!<br><br>

                    (2) <b>You form a habit by "repetition"</b> - Engage in <b>"active practice"</b> instead of "passive learning". The more you "repeat" an activity, the more your "brain changes" (create neuron pathways) to be more efficient at that activity. It is the "frequency" that makes a difference. <br><br>Example: When you start learning a musical instrument, it is very difficult. After you practice (repetition), the difficulty reduces. Practice more, the action becomes "automatic". Eventually, it may become so easy you can do it without thinking! </li><br>

                    (3) <b>Reduce friction</b> - Create environment where doing the (thing you want to do) is as easy as possible - make good habit take the path of least resistance! - Example: Many businesses use automation and technology to remove friection / make it easier to do stuff.<br><br>



                </ul>

        <br><br>
    	<h3>3Ô∏è‚É£ üìò 5 Second Rule (by Mel Robbins)</h3><br>

            <em>ü•ú Count down 5...4...3...2...1, and... JUST DO IT!</em><br><br>
                <ul>

                    <li><u>On health, exercise & everything else</u>:<br><br>

                        <b>Just do it!</b> You don't have to "feel like it", just do it! </li><br>


                    <li><u>How to be productive</u>:<br><br>

                        Have a morning routine. Focus on yourself first (preferably at home, since once you go to work, you will have lots of distractions). <b>Decide on your 3 musts</b>, and then just do it!</li><br>


                    <li><u>How to stop worrying</u>:<br><br>

                        When you catch yourself worrying, ask <b>"What am I grateful for?"</b> and <b>"What do I want to remember?"</b> It puts you in a positive mindset.</li><br>


                    <li><u>How to beat anxiety / fear - Part 1</u>:<br><br>

                        Re-frame the "negative feeling" into a "positive feeling" (such as <b>"excitement"</b>). <br><br>

                        Example, if you are anxious because you have to do public speaking, re-frame your "anxiety" to be like "I am feeling this way because I am excited".</li><br>


                    <li><u>How to beat anxiety / fear - Part 2</u>: <br><br>

                        Use <b>"anchor thoughts"</b> to re-direct your negative thoughts into something positive. You can come up with  your "anchor thought" beforehand.<br><br>

                        Example, if you are scared of flying, you can imagine how you are on a beach enjoying your holiday - Since you can imagine yourself on the beach, it means your flight went well.</li><br>


                    <li><u>Practice everyday courage</u>: <br><br>

                        <b>Nothing comes naturally until you practice it</b>! Do what your instinct tells you to do. Practice everyday courage, and build your confidence. As you do so, you will learn that you can count on yourself, trust your own abilities, honor your desires, and take control of your life! <b>Confidence is not a personality trait, it is a skill!</b></li><br>



                    <li><u>Find your passion</u>: <br><br>

                        <b>When you have an instinct to act, you must physically move and act on it</b>... or else, your brain will find some way to stop you. <b><br><br>

                        (1) Explore your passion</b> (what does your heart really want?) <br><br>

                        <b>(2) Take simple steps to explore the subject</b> (read up on it, take a course, write a plan, etc.)<br><br>

                        <b>(3) Have courage to commit</b> (decide that you are ready to commit... you will never "feel" ready...). Even if you are ready, it might not feel good in the beginning, but have faith and belief in yourself, and have courage, and do the work! </li><br>


                    <li><u>Relationships</u>: <br><br>

                        <b>Leave nothing important unsaid</b>. To improve a relationship, just "say it". Intimacy takes courage. There is no right time to have the conversation, ask the hard questions, say I love you, etc. There is only now. When your heart speaks, say it! Sometimes, there is no next time.</li><br>

                </ul>

                <li>Milk powder</li>
                <li>Water (around 4-5 cups? up to you)</li>
                <li>1 small plain yogurt (from the shop)</li>
            </ol>
        <em>Directions:</em> 
        <ol>
            <li>Mix milk powder and water (I prefer a thicker yogurt, so I add a bit more milk powder)</li>
            <li>Heat the milk until it just starts to boil, and turn off the heat</li>
            <li>Wait until the milk cools down a bit (warm to the touch), then mix in the yogurt</li>
            <li>Divide the milk-yougurt into glass containers (that has lid) - <strong>sieve the mixture when pouring in to remove lumps</strong></li>
            <li>Place the closed containers in a <strong>warm oven</strong>, and cover them with a <strong>warm cloth</strong></li>
            <li>normally, I will turn on the oven (and put the cloth inside) for a little while, then switch the oven off once I am ready to place the yougrt into the oven</strong></li>
            <li>Leave it for around <strong>8 hours</strong>, and put in the fridge when it is done (I usually make yogurt at night, and leave it overnight)</li>
        </ol>

    <!-- First Aid : Tactical Combat Casualty Care -->

        <h2>‚õëÔ∏è Tactical First Aid - (S) M.A.R.C.H. </h2>
        <p class="article-date">Created: 20 October 2025, Monday</p>
          
        <p>
            Recently attended a Medical First Responder (MFR) seminar and "Stop the Bleed Course".<br><br> 
            Instead of the "DRSABCD" acronym, they taught us "SMARCH". 
            SMARCH is a way for you to remember the order of <b>priority of care</b>.<br><br>

            <b>When to use "SMARCH" or "DRSABCD"?</b> 

            <br><br>I truly have no idea - but if I were to guess: <br><br>
             
             ‚ú™ <b>DRSABCD</b> may be more suited for general first aid situations; while<br><br>
             
             ‚ú™ <b>SMARCH</b> would be more suited for traumatic events, like gunshots, blasts, horrible accidents, mass injury, and similar kinds of stressful situations - so that you will know what to deal with  first. For example, this person is bleeding profusely, but also not breathing, and also has a head injury - which injury do you deal with first...?<br><br><br>

            Can have like a 4 man team. 3 people to help out and 1 person will be <b>taking records</b> (and also helping out) like record what you did, what time, what happened... so can hand it over to the next level medical personnel.<br><br>

            The US military has their format, hospitals also have their own (the checklist may be  different, but the purpose similar). Generally, it would be good to keep track of what happened and what time it happened - can be something like: At [time] found [patient] [where & what happened]; [time] applied tourniquet, etc.<br><br>

            After all is done, they will have a <b>"AAR"</b> (After Action Report) to review what happened, and what can be improved.<br><br>
        </p>

                    <li>If person is bleeding very very heavily, then apply a <b>"tourniquet" </b>
                     to stop the bleeding. Usually about 2-3 inches above the injury</li><br>
                     <li>There are some places that you <em>should not</em> put a tourniquet, 
                     example, the joints, or certain other parts (like neck).</li><br>
                     <li><b>"High and Tight"</b> is the motto for tourniquet (it is going to be painful)</li><br>
                    <li><b>Take note of the "time"</b> when a tourniquet is applied!</li><br>
                    <li>If no property tourniquet, can use a makeshift one (not so effective, but might be better than none).</li><br>
                    <li>If no tourniquet, apply direct pressure (eg. bandage/gauze) to try to stop the bleeding</li><br>
                    <li>If the wound is very deep, you can "pack" the wound, like roll balls of gauze and stuff it in the wound (basically to stop the bleeding), and wrap it firmly</li><br>

                    <li>Airway is the path from nose and mouth to the lungs</li><br>
                    <li>If the airway is blocked, the person cannot breathe</li><br>
                    <li>If the person is awake and talking then possibly airway is clear</li><br>
                    <li>But... also see if the person is likely to have their airway blocked... (for example, now awake, but later will pass out</li><br>
                    <li>If the person is unconscious, open the person's mouth to check their got any objects, blood, vomit, teeth in the mouth that would be likely to block their airway</li><br>
                    <li><b>Head tilt, chin lift</b> can help to open a person's airway</li><br>
                    <li>If person has spinal injury, <b>jaw thrust</b> may be the only way to open a person's airway</li><br>
                    <li>Can put the person in the <b>recovery position</b> once they are sorta breathing, to keep airway clear - also so example, if got eg. vomit or blood in mouth, it can flow out</li><br>
                    <li>You can use an <b>NPA</b> (nasopharyngeal airway) which is like some (green) tube, to stuff into the nose down to the throat to secure an open airway.</li><br>
                    <li>The size of the NPA should be from the <b>nose to the ear</b>. (Use the correct size!)</li><br>
                    <li>If you only have a bigger size, you can probably "cut" it to size, but this is NOT ideal</li><br>
                    <li>Put lubricant (eg KY jelly?) on the NPA before inserting into the person's nose. But if don't have, then use the patient's own saliva or blood also ok in a pinch</li><br>
                    <li>Once in a while may need to  use this other (suction tube thing) to suck out mucous or whatever from the NPA. The length of the tube to be inserted also nose to ear length, can note the length using you fingers</li><br>
                    <li><b>DO NOT use NPA if got facial injury or if you suspect brain injury!! (eg. if clear fluid flowing out of the nose)</b></li><br>

                    <li>Look at the chest to see if it rise and fall</li><br>
                    <li>Listen if got breaching sound (if got some obstruction maybe got like snoring or some wheezing?)</li><br>
                    <li>Feel if got breath</li><br>
                    <li>If person is not breathing, can give CPR (like the usual "Staying Alive" or "Baby Shark", etc.)</li><br>
                    <li>How to use the "bag valve mask" (i.e. the thing that got like the nose mouth plastic thing, and the round plastic bulb to squeeze) - remember <b>"C and E"</b>.</li><br>
                    <li>Put the nose/mouthpiece over the nose and mouth (don't want to have gaps for air to escape). Hold the mouthpiece top with your thumb and pointer finger in "C" shape - This is mainly to keep it in place (not so much the pressure). The "E" shape with the rest of your fingers is to press down the mask</li><br>
                    <li>(When testing on the dummy, I guess sometimes the chest didn't rise, cause the airway is not clear... so may be helpful to sorta angle the person's head like "Head Tilt Chin Up" for the human head also...)</li><br>
                    <li>Squeeze the bulb...</li><br>
                    <li>If person has like a wound on the chest area (eg. gunshot or stab wound) that will like cause people to "leak" the air... you can put this (occlusive dressing - plasticky dressing sticker) over it, basically to stop air from coming out.</li><br>
                    <li>They got some that are just stick on, some are like stick on but with one-way air vent to let air out</li><br>
                    <li>In a pinch, you can sorta have a plastic sheet over it, and stick 3 sides of it down. With one side open (the open part is like equivalent to the vent) and also allow the blood to flow out or whatever.</li><br>
                    <li>There is this pin thing that person can stick into the body; and also this way to open the throat - but I will never do it!!</li><br>

                    <li>Ensure that blood is flowing to keep organs working</li><br>
                    <li>Something like IV, IO? Like can administer blood or other fluids into the body.</li><br>
                    <li>This is also something I don't really know...and likely will never use in my life...</li><br>
                    <li>The US military apparently has this thing (with lots of needles), that is like in a round tube, that you sorta put on the chest (they have some sticker to sorta tell you where to stick this thing in), that will be the place to administer the stuff.</li><br>
                    <li>Other things you can do are, example: 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Check for other bleeding - Can sorta do like a "body sweep" - i.e. sweep the arms/legs/body/back of the patient with your two hands to see if there is any other bleeding from somewhere else in the body. You should be able to sorta "feel" like difference between blood vs sweat. (I suppose you should wear gloves for this...), and deal with it accordingly</li><br>

                            <li>Check for their pulse - Usually, example in the neck or wrist (usually the outer part of the wrist - i.e. opposite armpit part of the wrist)</li><br>

                    <li>Usually if people lose too much blood or whatever, can still get hypothermia (even if the outside temperature may be warm)!</li><br>
                    <li>Can put like blankets or what.</li><br>
                    <li>Head injury, I guess depends on what injury. But mainly can see how alert they are? (AVPU). Can wrap the bandage but really I guess wait for someone more medically trained to take over</li><br>

        <h2>üíá‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Hair Washing Technique</h2>
        <p class="article-date">Created: 24 May 2025, Saturday</p>

        <p>Earlier this month, I finally made a trip to the salon to cut my hair. <br><br>

        "Oh my, your hair is starting to thin..." said the close-to-retirement-aged hairdresser as he gently combed my wispy fringe, "if you do not do anything about it, you will likely be bald in twenty years, give or take".<br><br>

        Yes, of course I sensed an upsale coming up. But I was more concerned about my impending baldness - "Please tell me how to stop this from happening".<br><br>

        So, he gave me some common sense solutions (which I will not repeat here), and then he taught me how to wash my hair: <br><br>

        üë®‚Äçü¶≥üí¨ : <b><em>When you wash your hair, "massage" the scalp üíÜ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è don‚Äôt "scratch" it!</b></em>

        
        <br><br>
        ... And yes, I did end up buying that tiny tiny RM150 bottle of shampoo in the end üí∏üò≠.

        <h2>üå± Ajinomoto For Plants?</h2>
        <p class="article-date">Created: 20 October 2024, Sunday | Updated: 23 April 2025, Wednesday</p>

        <p>So apparently, the popular flavour enhancer "Ajinomoto" (aka MSG aka monosodium glutamate) can be put into your plants to make it bear more fruits and leaves.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Around 1 teaspoon for a medium sized potted plant will do the trick - supposedly. Mom is testing this on her lime trees. Will see if it works.</p>

        <br>

        <p><u>Update 23 April 2025</u>: When they said add "1 teaspoon" to the plant, they forgot to mention how many times a day/week/month - So, mom may (or may not) have over MSG-ed the plant resulting in some white-ish specks on the leaves, but... no fruits.</p>
